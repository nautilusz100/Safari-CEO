# Safari CEO

**Safari CEO** is a single-player business management and simulation game built in Unity.  
The player acts as the director of an African wildlife park and must maintain, expand, and successfully operate the safari using limited starting capital and available land. The game includes three difficulty levels, each affecting resource management, animal behavior, and park progression.

## 🎮 Game Overview

The world features procedurally generated **terrain** with hills, vegetation, and lakes, all of which can be placed or modified by the player.  
Animals fall into two functional groups:

- **Herbivores** – move in herds and feed on vegetation  
- **Predators** – hunt herbivores and roam dynamically  

Each animal requires food and water, and their **age influences their needs**, making ecological balance crucial.  
The park’s revenue comes from:

- **Animal sales**
- **Tourism**, including jeep tours and road-building across the terrain

### 🏆 Win & Lose Conditions

**Win condition:** maintain all park metrics above required thresholds for  
**3, 6, or 12 consecutive months** (depending on difficulty).

**Lose condition:**  
- bankruptcy
